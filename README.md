Pok√©dex is a mobile application built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) capable of listing Pok√©mons from various generations and display informations about each of them, just like the Pok√©dex from the original games and anime series. For such, the app consumes data from the APIs [pokemon-db-json](https://pokemon-db-json.herokuapp.com/) and [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

The application was made to practice React Native, consuming third-party APIs, displaying big amount of data with "infinite" scroll, navigation between screens, mobile styling with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and animations. The layout is based on [Flavio Farias](https://www.behance.net/gallery/95727849/Pokdex-App) and [Saepul Nahwan](https://dribbble.com/shots/6540871-Pokedex-App) design.
